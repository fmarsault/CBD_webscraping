ALE performed the weighing, transportation and load-out of a J tube cage (JTC) weighing 225t and measuring 24m high, and a transition piece (TP) weighing 717t and measuring 30m high for the offshore substation. ALE used calibrated load cells to weigh both of the pieces.  ALE used 20 axle lines of SPMT for the transportation of the JTC, while 40 axle lines of SPMT were used for the TP. The upright transportation of both pieces was a challenge due to their narrow base and high centre of gravity. ALE carried out the load-out of each piece in just six hours. They were installed on site by GeoSea in September 2017."

Ecosse Subsea Systems (ESS) has extended its trenching scope by providing seabed clearance at the project. Once the seabed is prepared ESS’s SCAR Seabed System will perform first pass and multi-pass trenching in preparation for Prysmian’s installation and burial of 81km of submarine cables which will connect the turbines to the offshore substation. The campaign lasted 116 days and ESS released a press release on 16/11/2017 stating the work was complete. The route preparation phase involved thousands of boulders being cleared over a total distance of 34km covering 45 inter array routes, followed by pre-cut trenching over a length of 83km in single and multi-pass modes."

ABT designed the three foundation and the tower foundation connections, performed quality control and provided implementation advice. The concrete mixture design was part of the engineering works. The required strength development, durability and workability of the concrete mixture were considered. The foundation design consists of three separate concrete bases founded on piles. Each base is 8 metres in diameter and rests on 18 Vibro piles. A combination of conventional rebar and steel fibres were used in the design. Compared to normally reinforced concrete, cracks were limited and the risk of building faults minimised. The tower anchorage consists of pretension anchors."

WatchKeeper meteorological and oceanographic data buoy deployed approximately 60km offshore Poland's coast. The buoy, procured by polish developer Baltic Trade and Invest (BTI), will be used as part of the Environmental Impact and Assessment campaign. This campaign will form part of the Environmental application for the offshore wind farm development.The WatchKeeper buoy is equipped to provide wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, solar radiation, directional waves, current speed and direction, conductivity, and water temperature in near real-time via satellite telemetry. The buoy also uses a new AIS Aid to Navigation device, which broadcasts buoy position and weather information to local vessel traffic. This both protects the buoy from collision by notifying vessels of its location, and can also act as an additional telemetry method providing data within radio range."

SSE will continue to invest in the project until the end of 2014. It will then review the situation and decide if it will invest in development during 2015. The reasons that it is continuing with the project are that it could still get on the FID Enabling for Renewables scheme and that costs could be reduced through engagement with the supply chain. The decision to continue into 2015 will depend on three factors namely; 1) an Investment Contract or a Contracts for Difference is secured, 2) SSE is able to reduce its stake from 75% to 50%, which it did so, and 3) a reduction in cost of construction and operation of the project.In January 2016 Copenhagen Infrastructure purchased 10% from SSE(40%)."
